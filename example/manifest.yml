    Data Package; available from https://github.com/FASTGenomics/FASTGenomics_Data_Package_Format
  short_description: In Silico Example Data Package
  preprocessing:
    notes: expression defined as at least one read present; cells with 0 expressed
      genes and genes expressed in 0 cells were removed; HGNC symbols were translated
      to Entrez IDs using org.Hs.eg.db version 3.4.2
    tools: R with Matrix and yaml packages as well as the Bioconductor package org.Hs.eg.db.
